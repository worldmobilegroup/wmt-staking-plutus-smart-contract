# World Mobile Community Guidelines

## Our commitment
We believe in a collaborative, inclusive community all working together harmoniously. Therefore we ask that you follow the below guidelines for all shared communication channels.

## Our standards
- Be tolerant of opposing views.
- Ensure that your language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
- Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.

## Our responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate
and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team through any of the public available channels. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
